# 🌐 Day 8 – App Service (Web App Deployment & Monitoring)

**Goal:**  
Deploy and manage a simple web application using Azure App Service.  
This lab demonstrates how to host a web app on the Azure platform, connect it to an App Service Plan, and monitor its activity — all on the free tier to preserve credits.
