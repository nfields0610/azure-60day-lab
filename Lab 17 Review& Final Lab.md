# ðŸ§© Day 17â€“ Review & Final Lab Test

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Validate all components created in previous Azure labs, ensuring compute, networking, storage, monitoring, and governance are fully operational within the **LABNN** environment.

---

### ðŸ§± Step 1 â€“ Review All Azure Resources in LABNN
**Task:** Review all deployed resources  
**Resource:** LABNN Resource Group  
**Notes:** Run the Azure CLI command below to confirm your environmentâ€™s resources and organization.

### ðŸ§± Step 2 â€“ Review Cost and Redundancy Decisions
**Task:** Analyze current Azure spend and storage redundancy settings  
**Resource:** Cost Management + Billing  
**Notes:**
- Open **Cost Management â†’ Cost Analysis** in the Azure Portal  
- Compare **LRS** (Locally Redundant Storage) vs **GRS** (Geo-Redundant Storage)  
- Identify cost-optimization opportunities and review any budget alerts  
- Confirm that tagging (e.g., `Phase=FinalLab`, `Owner=Nichelle`) helps track costs

### ðŸ§± Step 3 â€“ Verify VM Health via Azure CLI
**Task:** Confirm that VMs are running and healthy or deallocated to preserve cost
**Resource:** Virtual Machines (winlabvm02 / linuxlabvm01)  
**Notes:** Check the PowerState of both VMs to ensure theyâ€™re
